# DSApractice
This is a set of problems i will be practicing on my journey of learning dsa
Once i finish a set of problems i will do my best to keep this repository updated

All the folders created in this repo are on my experience . It is not necessary that the problems i could not think of a logic cannot be solved by others at first glance.
Also the problems i labelled as not found optimal solution may click next time i solve it
The reason i created such a folder is for me to go through them again if possible

The reason I am maintaining this repository is to help others and it also serves as a reason for me to remain consistent with solving more dsa problems on various topics

Hope whoever reads this repository finds it helpful
